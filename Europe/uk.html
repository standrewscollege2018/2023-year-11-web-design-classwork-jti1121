    <p>Living just north of London was perfect, as we were close enough to train into London for the day, but also had easy access to the M1 and M25. 
        <br> We could easily drive anywhere, and also had a train line passing directly through the town.</p>
    
    <p>We tried to travel every weekend, and some of our highlights are below:</p>

    <h2>St Alban's Cathedral</h2>

    <p1>This was our local cathedral, and is the site of the longest continuing Christian worship in the UK.</p1>
